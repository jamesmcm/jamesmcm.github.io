I've started this blog to save resources which have helped me in learning languages, concepts in statistics, and anything else which I think might help others too.

I am currently a PhD student in TÃ¼bingen, Germany in "Machine Learning for Personalised Medicine". I'm particularly interested in models combining genotypic and phenotypic measurements (such as gene expression, or methylation), in addition to the application of causal inference methods to justify causal conclusions from observational data, where possible.

I also intend to post summaries of my presentations and work here, as part of the "outreach" encouraged in my PhD programme.

I hope it will be useful to some others too!
