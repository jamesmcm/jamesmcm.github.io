  <h1 class="post-title">How to fix high CPU usage by the CacheDelete daemon in OS X Catalina</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2020-09-20</span>
  <hr class="within-post">
  <p>I recently had an ongoing issue with the <code>deleted</code> CacheDelete daemon
using huge amounts of CPU time almost constantly. This post covers how I
fixed it and a few tips for OS X recovery and performance improvements.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.</p>
<h2 id="deleted-daemon">deleted daemon</h2>
<p>The problem I had was that the <code>deleted</code> daemon was often taking 90%+ of
CPU usage on my 2017 Macbook Pro, resulting in massive stuttering when trying to use the
system.</p>
<p>Looking up details for the process, I found that <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254810/what-is-the-deleted-daemon-in-macos">the daemon is
responsible for purging caches</a>
and had caused issues for others. Unfortunately, on Catalina it is not
trivial to disable due to the read-only System volume and the built-in
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899">System Integrity Protection</a>
that forbids any changes to system files, even as root.</p>
<p>By looking at the output of <code>ps</code> we can see that the binaries are stored
in <code>/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CacheDelete.framework/</code>, meanwhile
the page linked above mentions that the registered applications with the
daemon are contained in plist files in <code>/System/Library/CacheDelete/</code>.</p>
<p>In order to fix this issue, we can simply move all of those plist files.
Then <code>deleted</code> will no longer run. Do <strong>not</strong> remove the <code>deleted</code>
binary itself or your system will fail to boot (at login if on a system
with an encrypted disk).</p>
<h2 id="removing-the-plist-files">Removing the plist files</h2>
<p>First we need to disable the System Integrity Protection (SIP), this must be
done in recovery mode. To access recovery mode reboot the Macbook and
press Cmd+R whilst it is booting up, the screen should flash white and
take you to a recovery shell with options to reinstall OS X.</p>
<p>In the menu bar at the top, select <code>Utilities &gt; Terminal</code> to access the
terminal and then run <code>csrutil disable</code>. You should receive a message
that the SIP is now disabled. Reboot the machine.</p>
<p>Log in as usual and open a terminal window. First you must mount the
System volume as writeable:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">$</span><span> sudo mount</span><span style="color:#bf616a;"> -uw</span><span> /
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then move the CacheDelete plist files:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">$</span><span> sudo mv /System/Library/CacheDelete /System/Library/CacheDeleteBackup
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now reboot and <code>deleted</code> should no longer run.</p>
<p>Note if you also moved
the actual binaries above then the system will no longer boot, this is
easy to fix (assuming you didn't remove them completely) but involves a
few extra steps if your hard disk is encrypted.</p>
<h3 id="mounting-an-encrypted-hard-disk-from-recovery">Mounting an encrypted hard disk from recovery</h3>
<p>First boot to recover mode and open a terminal as above. Then you need to unlock the encrypted disk.</p>
<p>Use <code>diskutil apfs list</code> to find the correct volume (check the capacity
and label), and copy the Logical Volume UUID (it will be something like
<code>B807C2A0-577F-3DB0-9002-F82B9137696C</code>).</p>
<p>Then unlock the disk with your disk password (this may be the same as
your user password):</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">$</span><span> diskutil apfs unlockVolume B807C2A0-577F-3DB0-9002-F82B9137696C
</span></code></pre>
<p>Once it is unlocked correctly, you can mount it with diskutil by name,
e.g."</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">$</span><span> diskutil mount disk2
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then find it mounted in <code>/Volumes/${LABEL}</code>, there you can make any
necessary fixes and then reboot.</p>
<h2 id="other-fixes">Other fixes</h2>
<p>The above steps fixed the issue I had with CacheDelete which was a
major problem for a few weeks. But I also recommend the following
improvements.</p>
<h3 id="disabling-spotlight">Disabling Spotlight</h3>
<p>Spotlight (the OS X file searcher) indexes all files for rapid
searching, but this indexing can be CPU and Disk IO intensive and run at
inopportune times (you may see this as the <code>mds_stores</code> process). Since I never use Spotlight, I just disable it
completely (I only use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>).</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist
</span></code></pre>
<p>Note that you need the SIP disabled to run that.</p>
<h3 id="disabling-transparency">Disabling transparency</h3>
<p>Disabling transparency helps to reduce CPU usage by the <code>WindowServer</code>
process.</p>
<p>Simply go to the accessibility settings and check Reduce Transparency
under Display.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I hope this helps anyone else facing the same issue, it was a huge
frustration for weeks. I've written this as much for my own reference
too!</p>
<p>Hopefully one day we'll be able to use Arch Linux at work too.</p>
