  <h1 class="post-title">My Rust 2021 roadmap: crates, concision, and community</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2020-09-24</span>
  <hr class="within-post">
  <p>The Rust core team recently released a <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/09/03/Planning-2021-Roadmap.html">call for blog posts</a> as part of
the 2021 roadmap for Rust. In this post I will detail my own experience
with Rust, and areas I'd like to
see improved during 2021.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Opinions expressed are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer.</p>
<h2 id="my-background">My background</h2>
<p>I'm currently a Data Engineer and over the last few months I have
proposed and started implementing the migration of our serverless data
ingestion pipelines to Rust. The requirements of these pipelines vary
but usually involve receiving some external data (e.g. via email or S3, possibly
via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-transfer-for-sftp-fully-managed-sftp-service-for-amazon-s3/">SFTP to S3</a>),
validating and transforming that data (with AWS Lambda) and loading it to a data
warehouse.</p>
<p>I originally proposed switching to Rust due to having deployment issues
with Python (when depending on native modules, like NumPy) due to
possible glibc version mismatches as well as the total size of the deployed
package.</p>
<p>Rust solves these issues by allowing us to compile a statically linked
binary with musl, and feature flags allow us to include useful code from
a shared crate without building in the entire crate and its
dependencies (for parts we don't need). <a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls">Rustls</a> also allows us to avoid any OpenSSL-related deployment
issues.</p>
<p>Carrying out this proposal has given me direct experience in solving
business problems in Rust, working with other team members to introduce
Rust to the team, and deployment in an enterprise environment (although
the hard parts of deployment are largely handled by other teams).</p>
<p>I have published two personal programs written in Rust: <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/vopono">vopono</a> for
running specific applications through VPN connections, and <a href="https://github.com/jamesmcm/s3rename">s3rename</a>
for mass-renaming keys in an S3 bucket. I have also written a few prior
blog posts on Rust, the most popular being <a href="/blog/intro-dod">about data-oriented design in Rust</a>
and <a href="/blog/a-practical-introduction-to-async-programming-in-rust">an introduction to async programming</a>.</p>
<p>To summarise: As a data engineer, I want to be able to easily test and
deploy statically linked Rust binaries on various platforms and
architectures, and interact with popular services and protocols without
friction.</p>
<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>
<p>When working as an engineer in an agile team, sprint velocity and
speed of delivery is key. Engineers want to use the language and tooling
that will help them to complete their tasks as quickly as possible,
without frustration or the need to dig deep in to the implementations of
dependencies.</p>
<p>Amongst engineers I have seen two main reasons for push-back against
Rust deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The language is perceived to be very difficult to write (mostly due to
lifetimes), low-level and slow to develop in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The language is perceived to be very new, with an immature and
unstable ecosystem that might be lacking critical functionality and
could lead to a loss of development time if some dependencies have to
be created in-house.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren't issues that can be solved directly necessarily (especially
the perception itself), but we can consider how the community can help
to turn around these perceptions.</p>
<h3 id="development-speed">Development speed</h3>
<h4 id="low-level">Low-level?</h4>
<p>The first misconception is that Rust is a low-level language and that
the experience might be similar to writing C (i.e. dealing directly with
malloc, etc.). I think a lot of this comes from Rust often being
compared to C and C++ implementations in benchmarks, and being more
strongly adopted in the systems programming community.</p>
<p>I think this will largely be countered by Rust usage becoming more widespread in other
domains, such as Web Development with crates like Actix, Rocket, Hyper, etc. on the
backend and Seed and Yew on the frontend, and Data Engineering with crates
like ndarray, Serde, Polars, Calamine, Amadeus and Ballista.</p>
<h4 id="difficult-to-write">Difficult to write?</h4>
<p>Rust is also often perceived as difficult to write, particularly due to
the lifetime notation. Here I think a lot of great work has already
been done with non-lexical lifetimes greatly simplifying the necessary
notation in many cases, and rust-analyzer providing a fast debug loop
(along with the ongoing efforts to improve error messages).</p>
<p>The main thing to note here for the future, in my opinion, is just how much
language and syntax improvements can help new users and further adoption. I hope Rust
continues to work on making the code more concise for the developer in
the majority of use cases. For Rust 2021 and beyond this might include
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2909">assignment with destructuring</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44762">auto-dereferencing in operators</a>,
and <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-lifetime-elision-1-1-structs-with-one-reference-field/4914">lifetime elision in structs</a>.</p>
<h4 id="slower-to-implement">Slower to implement?</h4>
<p>Related to the above point, Rust is often considered slower to develop
in (usually when compared to dynamic scripting languages like Python or
JavaScript). Here I think it's important to note that hitting lots of error messages
from the compiler or borrow checker during development doesn't
necessarily mean development is slower - as those errors are probably
catching lots of issues that might go unnoticed in other languages
(until you hit an issue in production).</p>
<p>In German there is a saying "Wenn schon, denn schon.", which roughly translates
to "if you're going to do it, do it properly". This is where I believe Rust
excels - whilst you might hit a few lifetime and ownership issues during
the development of your program, in the end you are saved from a whole
class of bugs and also aren't bound by issues like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock">Global Interpreter Lock</a>
or the lack of type safety as in simpler scripting languages.</p>
<p>But it is important to ensure
that the feedback loop is fast for the developer. Here I think the great
improvements in rust-analyzer have helped already, and hopefully there
will be further improvements to compile speeds to make this even faster
in the future.</p>
<p>Ultimately with the great tooling available, I think the development
speed can actually be faster in Rust than Python or Ruby when you
consider the whole software life cycle including fixing bugs and scaling
up the system.</p>
<p>However, development speed is also greatly affected by the availability
of relevant libraries.</p>
<h3 id="crates-and-ecosystem">Crates and ecosystem</h3>
<p>Rust <em>is</em> still a very new language, with the first stable release in
2015 and more widespread adoption with the release of Rust 2018. This
leads to a common concern that Rust may be lacking some libraries, and
so could cost significant developer time compared to languages with a
larger and more mature ecosystem.</p>
<p>There are already many excellent crates unique to Rust, such as Serde
which I miss when working with other languages. The great accessibility
of cargo, <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a> also make it easy to discover new crates.</p>
<p>However, there are still some areas for improvement for the ecosystem as
a whole. For example, Rusoto is still slightly less user-friendly than
<a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">boto3</a> (i.e. having to create <code>_Request</code> structs for each client
request).</p>
<p>Another example would be the need to provide root CA certificates (i.e. in a
PEM file) to rustls for use with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio-postgres-rustls">tokio-postgres-rustls</a> for example.
This is a minor issue, but one that is not necessary in more "batteries-included" libraries in other
languages (e.g. psycopg2 in Python).</p>
<p>These are small examples but can impact the learning curve for new
developers. As a community, I think we should try to create issues for
any such "paper-cuts" we come across and contribute pull requests where
possible.</p>
<p>Documentation is also relevant to this. Overall, Rust has excellent
documentation with the combination of rustdoc and mdBook being used to
provide crate documentation and detailed developer and contributor
guides. Throughout 2021 we should aim to expand existing documentation,
and ensure that it is accessible for new developers to do so too - for
example, contributing common use cases to <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/">the Rust cookbook</a>.
Myself, I struggled greatly with Serde's <code>deserialize_with</code> field attribute until looking at examples.</p>
<p>Hopefully in the future, the establishment of the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/08/18/laying-the-foundation-for-rusts-future.html">Rust foundation</a>
will eventually be able to provide commercial support to critical projects like
Rustls, Serde, and Tokio to ensure the crates are maintained and
improved in the long-term. I think this would help a lot with the adoption
of Rust in enterprise.</p>
<p>It'd also be great if Rust support were added to <a href="https://github.com/aws/jsii">jsii</a>
so Rust could be used with the AWS <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk">Cloud Development Kit</a> directly.</p>
<h2 id="other-small-issues">Other small issues</h2>
<p>There are some other small issues I'd love to see improved during 2021.</p>
<h3 id="auto-ref-in-pattern-matching">Auto Ref in pattern matching</h3>
<p>I couldn't find an RFC for this, but it'd great to be able to use a
static <code>&amp;str</code> when matching on an enum containing a <code>String</code>. i.e. so
<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=284089e5b13b5925449574ce2c5e41f2">this would be possible</a>:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#b48ead;">enum </span><span>MyEnum {
</span><span>    WithString(String),
</span><span>    Other,
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">fn </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">main</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span><span> myenum = MyEnum::WithString(&quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">test</span><span>&quot;.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">to_string</span><span>());
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">match</span><span> myenum {
</span><span>        MyEnum::WithString(&quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">test</span><span>&quot;) =&gt; {println!(&quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">Was string</span><span>&quot;)},
</span><span>        _ =&gt; {},
</span><span>    }
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Currently it is necessary to use a match guard (as far as I know). The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/42640">closest RFC I could find</a> handles auto deref but not ref.
Note that is already implemented.</p>
<h3 id="blocking-futures-without-an-async-runtime">Blocking Futures without an async runtime</h3>
<p>At the moment if any crate returns a Future, the developer has to use an
async runtime even if just to block on the future synchronously - i.e. <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.22/tokio/runtime/struct.Runtime.html#method.block_on">tokio's
block_on</a>.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if this were built in to the standard library (for the
blocking, synchronous case only) if possible.</p>
<h3 id="lifetimes-of-trait-objects-defaults-to-static">Lifetimes of trait objects defaults to 'static</h3>
<p>I have been caught out a few times by the lifetime of a trait object
defaulting to <code>'static</code>. Recently, in this <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/dialoguer/pull/81/files#diff-25c234b5525af56f20a73cb80796026bR47">PR to the dialoguer crate</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically the original struct:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#b48ead;">pub struct </span><span>Input&lt;</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">&#39;a</span><span>, T&gt; {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">prompt</span><span>: String,
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">default</span><span>: Option&lt;T&gt;,
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">show_default</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">bool</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">initial_text</span><span>: Option&lt;String&gt;,
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">theme</span><span>: &amp;</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">&#39;a</span><span> dyn Theme,
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">permit_empty</span><span>: </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">bool</span><span>,
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">validator</span><span>: Option&lt;Box&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; Option&lt;String&gt;&gt;&gt;,
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Requires that the validator closure has a <code>'static</code> lifetime, not the
<code>'a</code> of the struct. This can be fixed by specifying the <code>'a</code> lifetime
explicitly:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span>    validator: Option&lt;Box&lt;dyn Fn(&amp;T) -&gt; Option&lt;String&gt; + </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">&#39;a</span><span>&gt;&gt;,
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, I found the fact that it defaults to <code>'static</code> quite
unintuitive, this seems to be decided by the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/lifetime-elision.html#default-trait-object-lifetimes">default trait object lifetime rules</a>.</p>
<p>It'd be nice if this could be adjusted similar to the
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-lifetime-elision-1-1-structs-with-one-reference-field/4914">lifetime elision in structs</a>
RFC mentioned above so that if the containing struct has a specified
lifetime then the trait object would default to that lifetime (the
developer could always specify <code>'static</code> if required). Perhaps
this is impractical or undesirable due to other consequences though.</p>
<h3 id="deref-in-closure-signature">Deref in closure signature</h3>
<p>Related to the PR mentioned in the previous section, we have a
<code>Validator&lt;T&gt;</code> that must implement the validate method:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#b48ead;">pub trait </span><span>Validator&lt;T&gt; {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">type </span><span>Err: Debug + Display;
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">fn </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">validate</span><span>(&amp;</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">self</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">input</span><span>: &amp;T) -&gt; Result&lt;(), </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">Self::</span><span>Err&gt;;
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, this means if we want to validate a <code>String</code> we must pass a
<code>&amp;String</code> to validate. We cannot pass an <code>&amp;str</code>. If <code>T</code> were an <code>&amp;str</code>
itself then we could use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html">AsRef</a>
to accept a <code>String</code> in the signature, but the other way around doesn't
seem possible even though in the end the <code>&amp;str</code> and <code>&amp;String</code> are
equivalent for our purposes.</p>
<p>That is, we'd like to accept any type which
<code>T</code> could ref in to, not any type which could ref in to <code>T</code> (which is
what <code>AsRef&lt;T&gt;</code> provides us). Perhaps there are reasons this isn't
viable and the type arguments used above should change, but it was a
frustrating issue to hit as a developer.</p>
<p>As a side note related to <code>AsRef</code>, it'd be nice to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/3ntsbn/whats_the_point_of_asref/cvr5n5f/">introduce the syntax
mentioned here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I've covered a lot of different issues here, but I really wanted to
emphasise my own experience in introducing Rust to a team and the common
concerns that come up.</p>
<p>In summary, during 2021 I'd like to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rust expand to more domains outside of systems programming (i.e. web
development and data engineering).</li>
<li>Further language syntax improvements to keep Rust concise.</li>
<li>Continued improvements in IDE support (especially outside of VS Code).</li>
<li>Expanded documentation of common crates and use case examples (i.e.
<a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/">the Rust cookbook</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, a major part of making this possible is making it easier
for newer Rust developers to contribute to Rust itself (and major
crates). For example, I have written about some issues I've had above
and linked to some related RFCs - but I would have no idea where to
start with testing implementations to solve any of those issues.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/">Rust Forge</a> is a good start for this,
but I'd also love to see some worked examples of implementing features
and bug fixes. For example, <a href="https://github.com/jonhoo">Jon Gjengset</a>'s Crust of Rust series
has been excellent for covering the basics of the implementations of
some common Rust concepts, and it'd be great to see more blog posts focussed
on making improvements to Rust itself (or major crates).</p>
<p>Other possibilities are to host specific training sessions for new
contributors like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS26sqT09Pw">the Veloren project has done</a>,
or to host community bug-squashing days aimed at new contributors like
Arch Linux and KDE have done.</p>
<p>Having a larger pool of contributors would help to alleviate the
workload on current maintainers, and bring a more diverse range of
perspectives from different problem domains and platforms.</p>
<p>Overall, Rust is already in an excellent position with the most
welcoming community and most comprehensive documentation that I have
seen in any ecosystem. I look forward to what 2021 will bring!</p>
